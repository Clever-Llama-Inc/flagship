# Flagship

A simple Kubernetes configuration builder, with recipes for the kinds of stacks I tend to make.

## Recipes

- PostgreSQL: a stateful set with a clusterip service.
- RabbitMQ: a stateful set with a clusterip service.
- NGINX: a stateless deployment with load balancer service.
- Microservice: a stateless deployment with load balancer service.

## Todo

- Secret environment variables
- Config map mounts
- Log aggregation
